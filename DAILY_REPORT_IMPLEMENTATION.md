# Jira Daily Report Implementation

## Overview

The Jira Daily Report tool automatically generates daily reports from Jira work items and posts them to Microsoft Teams. It collects information from issues updated in the last 24 hours, groups them by Epic, and formats them in a readable markdown format.

## Implementation Status: ✅ COMPLETE

### Features Implemented

1. ✅ **Issue Collection**
   - Searches for issues updated in the last 24 hours using JQL
   - Retrieves comments and worklogs from the last 24 hours
   - Supports changelog tracking
   - Handles pagination for large result sets

2. ✅ **Epic Grouping**
   - Groups issues by their parent Epic
   - Issues without an Epic go to "Anything else" section
   - Displays Epic status and summary
   - Includes Epic URL for easy navigation

3. ✅ **Sorting and Organization**
   - Sorts issues by last updated time (most recent first)
   - Sorts updates within each issue chronologically
   - Sorts Epic groups alphabetically

4. ✅ **Report Generation**
   - Generates markdown-formatted reports
   - Follows the template format from `.ai/jira-daily-report-template.md`
   - Includes timestamps in configurable timezone
   - Truncates long comments/worklogs for readability
   - Includes clickable links to issues and epics

5. ✅ **Microsoft Teams Integration**
   - Posts reports via incoming webhook
   - Uses Adaptive Cards for better formatting
   - Handles errors gracefully
   - Supports workflow configuration via environment variables

## Configuration

The tool is configured via environment variables:

| Variable | Required | Description |
|----------|----------|-------------|
| `JIRA_HOST` | Yes | Jira instance URL |
| `JIRA_USERNAME` | No | Jira username (for Basic Auth) |
| `JIRA_PASSWORD` | Yes | Jira API token |
| `JIRA_PROJECT` | Yes | Project key to report on |
| `TEAMS_WEBHOOK_URL` | Yes | Microsoft Teams webhook URL |
| `REPORT_TIMEZONE` | No | Timezone for timestamps (default: UTC) |

## Usage Examples

### Local Development
```bash
export JIRA_HOST="https://your-domain.atlassian.net"
export JIRA_USERNAME="your-email@example.com"
export JIRA_PASSWORD="your-api-token"
export JIRA_PROJECT="PROJ"
export TEAMS_WEBHOOK_URL="https://your-webhook-url"
export REPORT_TIMEZONE="America/New_York"

go run ./cmd/jira-daily-report/main.go
```

### Docker
```bash
docker build -t jira-daily-report -f cmd/jira-daily-report/Dockerfile .
docker run --rm --env-file .env jira-daily-report
```

### GitHub Actions
The workflow runs automatically at 9 AM UTC on weekdays, or can be triggered manually.

## Report Format

The generated report follows this structure:

```markdown
# Daily Report DD-MMM-YYYY

From last updates in the last 24 hours

## [EPIC-123 In Progress: Epic Summary](https://jira.example.com/browse/EPIC-123)

### [Task | TASK-456 In Progress: Task Summary](https://jira.example.com/browse/TASK-456)

1. 14:30 John Doe commented: This is a comment
2. 15:45 Jane Smith log work 2h: Worked on implementation

## Anything else

### [Bug | BUG-789 Done: Bug Summary](https://jira.example.com/browse/BUG-789)

1. 10:15 Alice Johnson commented: Fixed the issue
```

## Technical Details

### JQL Query
The tool uses the following JQL query to find updated issues:
```
project = {PROJECT} AND updated >= -24h ORDER BY updated DESC
```

### Fields Retrieved
- `summary` - Issue title
- `status` - Current status
- `issuetype` - Type of issue (Task, Bug, Epic, etc.)
- `parent` - Parent issue (for Epic grouping)
- `updated` - Last update timestamp
- `created` - Creation timestamp
- `comment` - All comments
- `worklog` - All worklogs

### Expand Options
- `changelog` - Issue change history

### Update Detection
An issue is considered "updated" if any of the following occurred in the last 24 hours:
- Issue was created
- Issue was modified
- Comment was added
- Worklog was added

### Text Extraction
The tool handles both plain text and Atlassian Document Format (ADF) for comments and worklogs:
- Recursively extracts text from ADF structure
- Handles nested content nodes
- Preserves readability while truncating long text

### Epic Detection
The tool identifies Epics by:
1. Checking if the issue has a parent
2. Fetching the parent issue details
3. Verifying the parent's issue type is "Epic"
4. Grouping the issue under that Epic

## Testing

### Build Test
```bash
go build ./cmd/jira-daily-report
```
✅ Build succeeds without errors

### Integration Test
All existing tests pass:
```bash
go test ./jira/v3/...
```
✅ All tests pass

### Manual Testing Checklist
